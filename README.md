# Speaker-Recognition

Created model to classify speakers from frequency domain representation of speech recordings, obtained via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and created a 1D convolutional network with residual connections for audio classification. 


Prepared dataset of speech samples from different speakers with the speaker as label, augmented data with background noise and trained an FFT model on these samples to predict the correct speaker based on noise in the FFT samples.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68578215/204437864-fff80a2d-ce96-4f7d-b969-97711230c593.png)
